I am a doctoral researcher in the Machine Learning / Intelligent Data analysis group at Technische Universit채t Berlin and BIFOLD (Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data), working with [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert M체ller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en). My primary focus lies in enhancing the interpretability and efficiency of machine learning models.

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I accomplished my M.Sc. in Computer Science at TU Berlin in the year 2021. I did my Master's thesis, titled <em>"Analyzing the Importance of Temporal Information in 3D ConvNets for Human Action Recognition Through Explanations"</em> under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert M체ller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. J체rgen Gall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1CLaPMEAAAAJ).
